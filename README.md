# Team Management

## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was in wanting to use my familiarity with Node, my new found knowledge in package.json AND .js in conjunction with HTML/CSS to create an application.
- I built this project to display what I have learned about Node, .JSON, and new .JS methods throughout my school's most recent module.
- The problem solved within the challenge was building a functioning Team Management roster with fields that could be input by the user with using node. Utilizing a "Node" response would be building it into a standard HTML webpage with CSS styles attached to it.
- I learned how to build a functional app that utilized Node, .JSON, JS, HTML, and CSS.

## Installation

1. Created repository on GitHub.com and cloned repository locally to desktop.
2. Created a test folder, an employee folder, a source folder, and added all necessary .js files to these folders with an acommpanying CSS file in source folder.
3. Created an index.js, gitignore, and license outside of the folders THEN created package.json and a package-lock.json to outline the projects data/dependencies.
4. Created script for all .js and accompanying files to generate HTML/final product.
5. Pushed local changes back to main branch on original GitHub repository (via GitHub.com).


## Usage

Generate a README! Install Node, install Git Bash, and git clone repo link to use the Team Management app. Open gitbash after installing all of the above and open repo's main branch through Git Bash. Run "node index.js" through the gitbash command terminal and certain questions will be asked that you can type responses to (What is employee's name, ID, email, etc.). After, an HTML will pop up in VS Code which you can access by opening a live link. It will show all your inputs on the stylized HTML page!
